## Lubridate Assignment

### Problem 1:

• Load the wmata_ridership data frame into R from https://dcgerard.github.io/stat\_ 412_612/data/wmata_ridership.csv. For each month, calculate the proportion of rides made on a given day of the month. Then make box plots of the proportions of ridership vs day of the weak. But exclude any days from 2004 and 2005.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
```


```{r}
wmata <- read.csv("wmata_ridership.csv")

wmata %>% 
  ymd(Date) %>% 
  group_by(year(Date)) %>% 
  group_by(month(Date)) %>% 
  sum

```

### Problem 2:

• Write only one line of the code to return only the leap years fo years 2024, 3021, 2000 or 1800, 800, 5050, 600 and 7156.

```{r}

```
